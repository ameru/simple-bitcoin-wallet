# Creating your first test Bitcoin Wallet

### What you will need:
- Download Anaconda Navigator <https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads>
- Launch Spyder IDE
- A bitcoin test faucet (I used <https://bitcoinfaucet.uo1.net/>)
- Test network to view/validate your transactions (I used BlockCypher <http://www.blockcypher.com/>)

This is what your console should look like once you run your wallet:

This is what your wallet output should look like:

You can go onto BlockCypher to confirm your transaction went through:

Don't forget to return the test faucet bitcoin after you've borrowed it. Let other beginners try their hand at creating a wallet too!
